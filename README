    # 🎓 UACS Diaries

**UACS Diaries** is a choice-based visual novel game built in **Pygame**, developed as a university project. Players follow the stories of 5 different students from the University American College Skopje (UACS) as they prepare for their big presentation day.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎮 **Character selection screen** with animated transitions
- 🛏️ **Custom story scenes** for each character (bedroom, walk/drive, presentation)
- 🗨️ **Dialogue system** with character icons, name labels, and narrative lines
- 🧠 **Player choices** that shape the flow of conversation
- 💾 Dialogue stored in external `.json` files for easy editing and expansion

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pygame**
- **JSON** for dialogue and player data
- **Custom assets** (images, fonts, character art)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The game launches with a **character selection screen**.
2. The selected character is saved in `player_character.json`.
3. The game loads the corresponding story scenes for that character.
4. **Dialogue and choices are loaded from JSON** files to keep code modular.
5. Transitions (like fade-outs) create a smooth experience between scenes.

## 🗂️ JSON-Based Dialogue System

Dialogue and choices are stored in a simple JSON format:
```json
{
  "dialogue_lines": [
    ["Tina", "I didn’t sleep at all last night."],
    ["narration", "The sun rises over Skopje, calm but electric."]
  ],
  "choice_sets": {
    "Tina": [
      "Admit you're nervous",
      "Make a sarcastic joke"
    ]
  }
}


This makes it easy to:

    -Add or remove lines

    -Localize text

    -Let non-coders contribute dialogue

    -Expand character stories
